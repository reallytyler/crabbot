# Development

If you want to be inspired by this fork it, or just include the page!

## 🚀 Installation

### Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**. You can use the green "Code" button at the top or a git command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crab-bot.git
   cd crab-bot
   ```

2. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **If you are running a Gateway Proxy**, use this instead (uses a custom fork which contacts localhost:7878 and removes ratelimits and heartbeats):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-gateway.txt
   ```

4. **Add emojis**: You will need to add all emojis you want to Discord's App Emoji in the Dev Portal. If they aren't found there, they will be replaced with a placeholder. All emojis can be downloaded from the `emojis/` folder.

5. **Configure the bot**: Go inside of the `config.py` file and configure everything to your liking.

6. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## ✅ Done!
