## 🚀 Installation

### Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**. You can use the green "Code" button at the top or a git command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crab-bot.git
   cd crab-bot
   ```

2. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **If you are running a Gateway Proxy**, use this instead (uses a custom fork which contacts localhost:7878 and removes ratelimits and heartbeats):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-gateway.txt
   ```

4. **Add emojis**: You will need to add all emojis you want to Discord's App Emoji in the Dev Portal. If they aren't found there, they will be replaced with a placeholder. All emojis can be downloaded from the `emojis/` folder.

5. **Configure the bot**: Go inside of the `config.py` file and configure everything to your liking.

6. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## ✅ Done!

### Additional Configuration

**Environment Variables** (optional):
```bash
# Set your Discord token
export DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

# Then run
python bot.py
```

**Bot Permissions**: Make sure your bot has these permissions:
- Read Messages
- Send Messages 
- Embed Links
- Use Slash Commands

The main fixes:
- Added proper indentation to all bash code blocks
